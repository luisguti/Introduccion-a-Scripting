```{r}
library(tidyverse)


sets <- read_csv('sets.csv')
themes <- read_csv('themes.csv')
parts <- read_csv('parts.csv')
part_categories <- read_csv('part_categories.csv')

```
```{r}

counties <- read_csv("counties.csv")
counties

counties %>%
  dplyr::select(state, county, population, professional:production)

counties %>%
  dplyr::select(state, county, population, ends_with("work"), starts_with("income"))

```
**The rename verb**

```{r}

counties %>%
  count(state) %>%
  rename(num_counties = n)

counties %>%
  dplyr::select(state, county, poverty_rate = poverty)
```


**Using transmute**

```{r}
counties %>%
  transmute(state, county, population, density=population/land_area) %>%
  filter(population > 1000000) %>%
  arrange(density)
```

```{r}
counties %>%
  rename(unemployment_rate = unemployment)

counties %>%
  dplyr::select(state, county, contains("poverty"))
```


**Joining Data With dplyr**

```{r}

view(sets)

sets
themes



```

```{r}
sets %>% 
  inner_join(themes, by=c("theme_id" = "id"))
```
```{r}
view(parts)
view(part_categories)

view_parts <- parts %>%
  inner_join(part_categories, by = c("part_cat_id" = "id"))
  
view(view_parts)

view_parts <- parts %>% 
  inner_join(part_categories, by = c("part_cat_id"), suffix = c("_parts","_parts_categories"))

view(view_parts)

```
